# Precise Text Summarizer: AI-Powered Summarization App with LangChain and Groq

Efficient text summarization app built for developers and content creators. Leverage LangChain and Groq AI to generate concise, comprehensive summaries without omitting key details. Ideal for AI summarization tools, open-source LLM projects, and quick content analysis.

# Project Description
This text summarization application uses LangChain for intelligent processing and Groq Cloud for fast inference with open-source LLM models like Llama 3. It ensures precise summaries by capturing all important points, facts, and insights. Optimized for speed with single-pass "stuff" chain for shorter texts and map-reduce fallback for longer ones. Perfect for AI content creation, technical writing, or integrating into custom LLM projects


## Key Features

- Precise Summarization: Generates accurate, detail-rich summaries without missing critical information.

- Speed Optimizations: Uses lighter models (e.g., Llama 3 8B) and efficient chains for faster execution.

- User-Friendly UI: Built with Streamlit for easy text input and real-time results.

- Customizable Prompts: Ensures comprehensive coverage of key details in open-source AI models.

- Streaming Output: Simulated or native streaming for a responsive feel in text summary generation.

- Scalable Handling: Manages short and long texts seamlessly with LangChain text splitting.
## Installation

To set up this text summarization app locally:

* Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YarraguntlaNitish/LLM_Text_Summarizer

cd precise-text-summarizer
```
* Install dependencies (Python 3.8+ required):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* requirements.txt contents:
```bash
streamlit
langchain-groq
langchain
```

## Usage/Examples
Run the app and start summarizing:

* Launch with Streamlit:
```python
streamlit run summarizer.py
```
* Open in your browser (localhost:8501).

* Enter your Groq API key and paste text.

* Click "Summarize" to get a precise text summary â€“ ideal for AI content creation or custom LLM projects.

Example: Input a long article; output a concise version retaining all key insights.


## Configuration

* Model Selection: Defaults to Llama 3 8B for speed; switch to 70B in code for deeper analysis.

* Prompt Tuning: Customize the template for specific text summarization needs.

* Length Handling: Auto-switches chains based on input size for optimal AI summarization performance.
